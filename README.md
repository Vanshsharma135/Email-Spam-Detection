# Email-Spam-Detection
 In the Email Spam Detection ML Model, we employ various machine learning algorithms, including but not limited to Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These algorithms work in tandem with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as tokenization, stopword removal, and feature engineering, to analyze the email content and extract meaningful patterns from the text. Through supervised learning, the model is trained on labeled datasets, enabling it to make accurate predictions and effectively classify incoming emails as spam or legitimate, contributing to an enhanced email security system.
